h1. Automatic Helpers

Soks has a range of helper classes:
* Automatic summaries - Scan for other wiki pages and create new pages that have lists of relevant pages (e.g. Known Bugs)
* Automatic counters - Watch for certain events and count them (e.g. most popular pages, most frequent visitor, most prolific author)
* Automatic importers - Look outside the wiki and do things like mirroring rss feeds, or the contents of an e-mail folder
* Automatic maintenance helpers - Prune old revisions, merge others, permanently remove deleted pages etc.
* Automatic exporters - Take data from the wiki and put it elsewhere.

The api for classes to modify the wiki is pretty simple, so you should be able to create what you want pretty quickly.
