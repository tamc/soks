h1. Version 1-0-1 released

This is a minor bugfix release.  See how to install soks, or how to upgrade soks for instructions.  There is a full list of changes but in brief, this fixes:

* Fixed bug: Wrong title in Result Search page
* Fixed bug: AutomaticSummary does not reflect changes to summarised pages
* Fixed bug: Does not redirect pages with no view
* Fixed bug: E-mail addresses with hyphens not recognised

However, there are still plenty of known bugs, although none of them should cause much problem day to day.
