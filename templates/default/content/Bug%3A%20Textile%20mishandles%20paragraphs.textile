The "paragraph not kept separate" below should appear on a separate line from "A paragraph" but does not.

<pre>
Something
</pre>
A paragraph

A paragraph not kept separate
# Blah

The cause seems to be some interaction between the pre block and the following list block.  Putting a blank line after the pre or before the list makes it function as expected:

e.g.

<pre>
Something
</pre>

A paragraph

A paragraph not kept separate
# Blah

or

<pre>
Something
</pre>
A paragraph

A paragraph not kept separate

# Blah

This is possibly a bug with Redcloth rather than soks.
