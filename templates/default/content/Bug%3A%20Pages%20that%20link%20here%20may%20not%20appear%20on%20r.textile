The pages that link here sidebar may not appear if you:
# Run a soks wiki
# Shutdown the wiki gracefully so that it saves its caches
# Modify a wiki page off-line (everything is ok if you add a page)
# Restart the wiki and it succesfully reloads its caches

There are two workarounds:
# Either delete the caches before restarting in step 4 above
# Or edit any page in the wiki after restart.  The pages that link here sidebar will then reappear.

Not sure yet as to the cause of this bug, but it doesn't seem to be a showstopper so I'm going to release v1-0-0 anyway. --tamc
