h1. Bug competing edits

I had a case today where I was evidently editing a page at the same time someone else was.  He won and my edits were trashed upon save.  (Or at least this is what I surmise happened.)

Is this possible?  --Bil

Umm, trashed on save?  I hope not.  I hope that if you look at the 'show all changes' for the page it will show both edits in the history?  I *seriously* want to know if they are not.

p(. I was paying more attention this time.  Two of us were editing the same page.
I saved my changes, and they showed up on the page.
Next, he saved his changes, and my changes were removed (but still available
via the "show all changes"). --Bil

As for a solution.  There seem to be two routes:
# Put a 'lock' on the page, so that only one person can see the edit view at once.
# Try and merge competing edits.

I would prefer to merge, but don't know how to implement...
