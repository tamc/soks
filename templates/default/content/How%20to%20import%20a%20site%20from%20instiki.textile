h1. How to import a site from instiki

[[ Instiki => www.instiki.org ]] is great, and was definitely an inspiration for this site.  If, however, you wish to import a wiki from instiki to here then you need to:

# Launch your instiki wiki
# Go to 'export' and click on 'Markup (textile)'
# Unzip the downloaded folder.
# Create a soks wiki: <code>soks-create-wiki.rb</code>
# Stop the wiki <code>ctrl-c</code>
# Copy the contents of the downloaded folder (step 3) into soks-wiki/content
# Start the wiki <code>ruby soks-wiki/start.rb</code>

Your instiki content should then appear.  Note that all the links still work, but that all the pages have their WikiWord names.
