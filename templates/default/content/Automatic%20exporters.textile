h1. Automatic Exporters

There is currently a single class that can keep a static html mirror of a wiki.  See how to export a site from this wiki for more occasional exports.

h2. Wiki 2 Html

This class watches for changes to the wiki, and when they occur, writes an html version of the page into a specificed directory.

To use put the following in your start.rb file:
<pre>
<code>
require 'wiki2html'
Wiki2Html.new(wiki,view,
		:views_to_copy => ['view','meta','rss'], # This is what views of the page to copy accross
		:extension => '.html', # this is the extension to put on the files
		:destination_dir => '/Users/tamc2/Sites', # This is the folder where the html is put
		:destination_url => 'http://localhost/~tamc2') # Where relevant, urls will be rewritten to start with this
</code>
</pre>

Note, this doesn't copy accross uploads or other static files.  You will need to point whatever server you are using to view these files to the attachment directory in the wiki as well.
